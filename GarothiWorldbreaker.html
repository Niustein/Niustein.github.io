        <h2>Boss Abilities:</h2>
        <p id="BAbilities">-<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246220/fel-bombardment">Fel Bombardment</a> will target one of the two tanks and fire five projectiles at the tank that each have a travel time. <br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this happens the tank that was not targeted taunts the boss, the tank targeted by Fel Bombardment runs away from the group to the left side before returning to the boss <br><br>
        
        - <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244410/decimation">Decimation</a> will randomly target a few members of the raid. After a short period they will drop a circle underneath where they're standing and after another short period the circles will explode. <br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever gets targeted by Decimation should quickly run to the right or back of the arena, drop the circles and rejoin the raid in the middle <br><br>
        
        - <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244761/annihilation">Annihilation</a> will place a number of green circles on the ground and launch a missile at these locations. If nobody is inside of the circle when the missile hits, the entire raid will take a large amount of damage. If there are people inside, it will do significantly less damage split amongst the people inside of the circle <br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Annihilation goes off, DPS and Healers need to quickly get into the circles, one person is enough to absorb the entire amount of damage on both normal and heroic. <br><br>
        
        - <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244152/apocalypse-drive">Apocalypse Drive</a> happens at 60% and 20% hp on normal (65/35% on heroic). Garothi will begin casting Apocalypse Drive and will become untargetable. Two cannons will become active in the fight, one corresponding to Annihilation and one corresponding to Decimation. When you destroy a cannon, the ability linked to the cannon you destroy will stop occurring in the fight. The other ability will become empowered. Whichever ability becomes empowered will influence more people at a time whenever it is cast <br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd recommend killing the Annihilator first, decimation is easier to deal with. <br><br>
        
        - <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244969/eradication">Eradication</a> occurs after one of the cannons are destroyed in Apocalypse Drive. Garothi will begin casting an ability that deals a massive amount of damage and knocksback all players, but the damage is reduced the farther away you are.<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The entire raid should run to the back of the room for the cast to minimize the damage taken <br><br>
        
        
        - <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246655/surging-fel">Surging-Fel (Heroic Only)</a> will occur during Apocalypse Drive and for the rest of the fight after the second Apocalypse Drive. A large beam will cover a portion of the arena. <br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all raid members should step to either side of the beam to avoid taking massive damage
