        <h2>Boss Abilities:</h2>
        <p id="BAbilities">
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247367/shock-lance">Shock Lance (P1)</a>Stacking DoT on Tank which causes them to take more damage. In addition when shock lance goes out again for each DoT on the tank it will hit a random raid member<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanks should swap on 3/4 stacks (as soon as it falls off the other tank)<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247376/pulse-grenade">Pulse Gernade (P1)</a>Lobs a gernade that persist on the ground until triggered. Upon detonation, explodes dealing large damage to anyone in a 3 yard radius <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DPS should avoid hitting these by rotating as a unit. The tank not affected can hit a gernade to reduce the clutter on the platform, as this is the location for both phase 1 and phase 3<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247552/sleep-canister">Sleep Canister (P1)</a>lobs an undodgeable canister at several players and put them in a slumber for 20 seconds. When this debuff expires or is dispelled, anyone within 7 yards will get slept for 8 seconds (and this debuff cannot be dispelled)  <br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person targeted by Sleep Canister moves away from the group, healers make sure no one is near the target before dispelling them<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248252/infernal-rockets">Infernal Rockets (All Phases)</a>will target anyone who is not on the same platform as Imonar.

        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247687/sever">Sever (Phase 2)</a>Stacking DoT on the tank.<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanks should swap on 3 stacks (as soon as it falls off the other tank)<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247949/shrapnel-blast">Shrapnel Blast (P2)</a>Similar to Pulse Gernade will cause zones on the ground which deal a large amount of damage and leave anyone in the area with a hard hitting DoT.<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All players should avoid these<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=247716/charged-blasts">Charged Blast (P2)</a>will target two players from ships around the arena and after 7 seconds will blast these players (and anyone in line with these players) knocking them back and leaving a dot which lasts for 30 seconds.<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If targetted by Charged Blast, move to the ends of the arena and make sure that there is no other player in line with the blast.<br><br>
                
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=250255/empowered-shock-lance">Empowered Shock Lance (P3)</a>Works similar to Shock Lance from P1, but is now permanent<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanks should swap every few stacks to keep the damage to the raid as low as possible for as long as possible<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248068/empowered-pulse-grenade">Empowered Pulse Gernade (P3)</a>instead of lobbing gernades at players, random players will be affected by empowerd pulse gernade and will pulse AoE damage from them. <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All players in phase 3 should be split to avoid taking un-necessary damage from empowered pulse gernade<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248070/empowered-shrapnel-blast">Empowered Shrapnel Blast (P3)</a>Litters the area with green swirlies on the ground which deals a moderate amount of damage and puts a permanent dot on the player<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Players should move out of the swirlies and should never be hit by them as they cause a lot of damage to your healers<br><br>        
        
        </p> 
        
        <h2>Transition Phases:</h2>
        <p id="extraInfo">
        -At 66% and 33% Imonar will cross a bridge connecting the two platforms and begin channeling Conflagration and lose the Infernal Rockets ability. This ability hurls burning orbs down the platform which deal a massive amount of fire damage to any player that gets hit by it, as well as slowing them by 50% for 8 seconds. During the channel, Imonar takes 99% reduced damage. When this ability is interrupted, he regains Infernal Rockets. <br><br>
        
        -On the bridge there are many pulse gernades and statis traps that players must avoid. Although players should coordinate to hit a few a of the traps as these will remain on the bridge for the second intermission along with blastwires which deal raid wide fire damage when triggered.
