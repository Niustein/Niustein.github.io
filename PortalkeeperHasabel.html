        <h2>Boss Abilities:</h2>
        <p id="BAbilities">
        
        - <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244016/reality-tear">Reality Tear</a>puts a dot on the tank and upon expiring does a burst of damage to the entire raid<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanks should swap on 3 stacks<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244677/transport-portal">Transport Portal</a>Summons adds based on which phase of the fight it is that must be dealt with <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All DPS on the main platform should immediately swap to the adds and burst/cleave them down before resuming damage on the boss.<br><br>
        
        - <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=243983/collapsing-world">Collasping World</a>will place a large circle originating from the boss that does a massive amount of damage to anyone standing within. Upon expiring, the raid takes some damage<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanks should be tanking the boss along the edge of the arena so that players have more room to maneuver out of the circle <br><br>
        
        - <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244000/felstorm-barrage">Felstorm Barrage</a>will cross the arena with a large rectangular beam (3 beams on heroic) and will damage and knock back any players standing in the beam upon detonation.<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All players should make sure to avoid standing in the detonation zone. Especially important for the tank and any melee DPS as the knockback CAN knock players off of the arena<br><br>
        
        - Empower <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244318/empowered-portal-xoroth">Xoroth (90%)</a>,<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246082/empowered-portal-rancora">Rancora (60%)</a>,<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246157/empowered-portal-nathreza">Nazthreza (30%)</a>activates the fire/poison/void portals at certain boss HP thresholds and summons an elite mob. While the elite mob is alive, the raid is taking high ticking damage from "Empowered-Portal-<Platform Name>" and after the elite dies the dot becomes "Portal-<Platform Name>" which still does ticking raid wide damage but significantly less<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The raid should be split into two and the portal team should go up to engage this elite mob. All three elite mobs can cast Unstable Portal which should be interrupted. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vulcanar (xoroth's portal) can also cast Flames of Xoroth deals moderate damage and applies a dot to all players within 10 yards.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady Dacidion (rancora's portal) can cast posion essence and felsilk wrap. The first places a dot on all players on the platform which deals 10% of current health per second, and felsilk wrap deals damage a player and immobilizes them until the wrap is destroyed.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord Eilgar (nathreza's portal) will cast Delusion's on a healer which reduces their healing and absorbs by 100% but gives them 2% mana back per second, should be dispelled when mana is not a concern. He will also cast Corrupt which hits all players within 20 yards and increases the damage they take by 15% for 4 seconds.<br><br>
