        <h2>TL;DR</h2>
        <ul id="TLDR">
            <li>Tanks should be on any Fel-Infused Destructors or Eonar will take a lot of damage</li>
            <li>This is an add based tower defense fight, where the players are the towers</li>
            <li>(Heroic Only) Put Spear of Doom on the side of the lanes</li>
            <li>Recommended Lust/Hero timings: Save for hectic moments like when bats arrive with other lanes</li>
            <li>?</li>
            <li>Loot</li>
        </ul>    
        
        
        <h2>Strategy:</h2>
        <p id="BAbilities">
        
        -There are two abilities (3 on heroic) fired from the Paraxis ship above and 6 different adds that spawn (7 on heroic)) <br><br>

        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=246313/paraxis-artillery">Paraxis Artillery</a>randomly deals small bursts of damage to the raid<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This ability ensure that while people are running all over the place that a healer players will require a healer<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248326/rain-of-fel">Rain of Fel</a>targets a number of players and after a few seconds deals a burst of damage to that player and anyone within 8 yards.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Players have to make sure that they are not within 8 yards of any player that has the rain of fel ability on them<br><br>
        
        - <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248861/spear-of-doom">Spear of Doom (Heroic Only)</a>targets a player and fires a fel-laser beam that follows the player for several seconds. This trail persists for the rest of the encounter Players standing on this path will take damage, and enemy forces on this path will have their movement speed increased by 30%<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure to put the beam on the sides of the paths so that enemy forces get the buff as little as possible <br><br>
