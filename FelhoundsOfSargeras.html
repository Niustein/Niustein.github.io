            <li>Stack for Siphon Corruption (+ Weight of Darkness on Heroic)</li>
            <li>If tank on shadow dog does not have fear immunity, 2 people with blink/dashes will need to jump in if shadow dog tank gets weight of darkness </li>
            <li>Recommended Lust/Hero timings: On the pull</li>
            <li>?</li>

        <h2>Boss Abilities:</h2>
        <p id="BAbilities">
        
        - <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=254747/burning-maw">Burning/Corrupting Maw</a> is a large hitting magic attack that targets a tank (and stacks). The next few melee attacks will cleave in front of the dogs. <br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody should ever be in front of the dogs outside of the tanks, as the cleave will possibly one-shot anybody who does <br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244051/soul-link">Soul Link</a>makes both dogs have a shared health pool<br><br>
        
        - <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244050/destroyers-boon">Destroyer's Boon</a>will buff the dogs damage by 100% (and all their abilities) if they are within 40 yards of each other <br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On normal difficulty it is possible to tank both dogs together as the damage is tolerable. On heroic this is impossible in current gear levels. <br><br>
        
        - <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244057/enflame-corruption">Enflame Corruption</a>and<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244056/siphon-corruption">Siphon Corruption</a> occurs at 100% energy. Dogs gain energy at different rates, so multiple overlapping of different abilities  will occur. Enflame Corruption does raid-wide damage and targets players with the "Enflamed" debuff. These players will explode after 4 seconds (not split) so these players must not be within 8 yards of another player. Siphon Corruption will deal raid-wide damage and targets players with the "Siphoned" debuff. These players will explode after 4 seconds (split) so these players must be within 8 yards of each other  <br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stack on fire dog for Siphon Corruption, split away for Enflame Corruption <br><br>
        
        - <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244768/desolate-gaze">Desolate Gaze</a>and<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244131/consuming-sphere">Consuming Sphere</a>occurs at 33% energy. Desolate Gaze (fire) targets a number of players in the raid and will shoot a lane of fire at each player originating at the fire dog. Consuming Sphere (shadow) will target a location and launch a sphere originating from the shadow dog. This sphere will continually drag in all raid members and deal damage to those caught in the sphere <br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you get desolate gaze, point it away from the raid who may be stacked on the fire dog. For consuming sphere, use movement abilities and do your best to avoid getting caught in the sphere <br><br>
        
        - <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244086/molten-touch">Molten Touch</a>and<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244071/weight-of-darkness">Weight of Darkness</a>(Heroic Only) occurs at 33% energy. Molten Touch will raise one player into the air and launch lava balls at the other raid members. Weight of darkness will target a number of players and apply a 20 second fear upon expiry. This fear is split amongst all people in the circle, and will NOT fear if there are 2 other players within the circle<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The raid should stack on the fire dog for weight of darkness and split up to avoid being hit by molten touch. If the shadow dog tank cannot avoid fears, two players MUST jump in and help the shadow dog tank.<br><br>
