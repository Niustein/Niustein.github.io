            <li>P3: Don't tank sword/dagger big adds together</li>
            <li>P3: ONLY interrupt cosmic beacon and nothing else</li>
            <li>P4: orbs #1 priority when they're up. Now big bombs go to other side of field</li>
            <li>P4: When dead, pick up orbs to give raid titanforge buff</li>
            <li>P4: Keep tree alive as long as possible</li>

        <h2>Boss Abilities:</h2>
        <p id="BAbilities">
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248499/sweeping-scythe">Sweeping Scythe (P1/P2)</a>. A frontal cleave that applies a defull which makes the user take 75% (150% on heroic) more damage from future sweeping scythes.<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanks should swap on ~3 stacks of this debuff<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=256457/cone-of-death">Cone Of Death (P1)</a>Argus picks a target and leaves behind a cone of death fog originating from his position. <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The raid should all be stacked on the same line from the wall to the boss. When Argus picks a target, players have a few seconds to move out of the way before the explosion hits leaving behind a cone of death fog. Any player standing on death-fog takes a moderate amount of damage every second, making it quite lethal if people are positioned incorrectly<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=248317/soulblight-orb">Soulblight Orb (P1)</a>. Random players receive a debuff where upon expiring leaves a circle of death fog on the ground.<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Players with the soulblight orb debuff should be wary of how much time is left on their debuff and the time remaining until cone of death. If cone of death is incoming before the soulblight explosion, players should wait until a target has been picked for cone of death before moving in order to assure that cone of death is placed correctly.<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=257296/tortured-rage">Tortured Rage (P1/P2/P4)</a>. At fixed intervals, deals a moderate amount of damage to all players.<br><br>
                
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=253901/strength-of-the-sea">Strength of the Sea (P1)</a>and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=253903/strength-of-the-sky">Strength of the Sky (P1)</a>. Two random players will receive these buffs. After a couple of seconds an orb will drop at the location of these two players. Sky gives 2000 mastery and critical strike and Sea gives 2000 haste and versatility. These buffs stack (up to 5 times). In normal, the buff lasts 1 minute whereas in heroic the buff lasts 30 seconds
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=256674/golganneths-wrath">Golganneth's Wrath (End of P1, Start of P2)</a>. The outer circle of the arena becomes coated in lightning and the death fog gets cleared. All players should be in the center of the arena for this transition<br><br>
                
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=255199/avatar-of-aggramar">Avatar of Aggramar (P2)</a>. A buff that is placed one one of the two tanks that increases movement speed by 40% and also increases HP by 100%. Also any damage that a player takes inside of the radius of the buff will be redirected towards the tank. <br><br>

                
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=250669/soulburst">Soulburst (P2/P4)</a>. In P2 and P4, Argus marks 2 players with a small bomb that deals a moderate amount of damage after it explodes. <br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=251570/soulbomb">Soulbomb (P2/P4)</a>. Similar to Soulburst except Soulbomb does a lethal amount of damage. In P2, the soulbomb target should be positioned away from the raid beside the tank with avatar of aggramar. In P4, the soulbomb target should be as far away from the raid as possible. <br><br>
              
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=251815/edge-of-obliteration">Edge of Obliteration (P2)</a>. Scythes will go from one end of the arena to the other. Players should make sure they're not standing in the marked areas when they appear<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=252707/cosmic-ray">Cosmic Ray (P3)</a> will point a beam at the target dealing damage to anyone in line with the cosmic master and the player. Players targeted by cosmic ray should stop moving and allow others in the raid to get to a safe spot.<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=253061/starblast">Starblast (P3)</a> Inflicts low damage to a random enemy. <br>

        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=252616/cosmic-beacon">Cosmic Beacon (P3)</a>. Selects a player as a targeting beacon for Cosmic Smash, landing at their position after 4 seconds. Cosmic Smash leaves behind a nasty DoT on the entire raid..<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cosmic beacon MUST be interrupted. Two going off will likely wipe a raid. On heroic. After being interrupted the cosmic masters cannot be interrupted again for 20 seconds. Therefore, players must ONLY intterupt cosmic beacon<br><br>

        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=255496/sword-of-the-cosmos">Sword of the Cosmos (P3)</a>. One of the two buffs the cosmic masters can get. Sword of the cosmos increases melee damage by 200% and also increases the damage of any nearby cosmic master by 20%. The cosmic master with this buff must be taked alone and away from all other adds. Sword of the Blade (P3) is similar except it just increases the melee damage of that cosmic master by 300%.<br>
                
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=258039/deadly-scythe">Deadly Scythe(P4)</a>. Deadly Scythe replaces Sweeping Scythe but similar. The main difference between it lasts permanently and stacks at 200% instead of 75/150.<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanks should stay on Argus until death, and quickly use Eonar to revive after dying.<br><br>      

        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=257299/ember-of-rage">Ember of Rage (P4)</a>. A large number of swirlies will start to land onto the arena. Getting hit by one of these puts a permanent stacking DoT. Players should make sure to dodge these, as getting hit means more strain on the healers and almost certainly means death, using more charges of Eonar<br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=256393/reorigination-pulse">Reoriginating Pulse (P4)</a>. At fixed intervals, Orbs will spawn around the arena. These orbs must be killed as soon as possible, as shortly after appearing they will expand (based on remaining health) and deal a massive amount of damage to the raid.<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanks should stay on Argus until death, and quickly use Eonar to revive after dying.<br><br>              
                    
                
        </p> 
        
        <h2>Phase Information:</h2>
        <p id="extraInfo">
        -Phase 1 lasts from 100% to 70%<br><br>
        
        -During this time. Players should stack and move counter clockwise to avoid cone of death, while also placing soulblight orb in an organized manner. <br><br>
        
        -Phase 2 lasts from 70% to 40% <br><br>
        
        -During this phase. Players should be stacked as close to Argus as possible, and should move soulblight/soulbomb to their respective corners of the room while dodging scythes <br><br>
        
        -Phase 3 lasts until all of the cosmic masters are dead <br><br>
        
        -During this phase, players should focus the cosmic master that they deal addition damage too, as well as make sure that cosmic beacon never goes off. Tanks need to make sure that the sword/blade adds are not tanked together. <br><br>
        
        -Phase 4 lasts from 40% to 0% <br><br>
        
        -During this phase, players need to make sure that the orbs that spawn are killed as quickly as possible. soulBOMB should be taken to the opposite side of the arena, and soulBURST should be taken to the sides. Any DPS that dies during this phase should stay in the dead realm and pick up orbs that spawn from the orbs that died in the living realm.
