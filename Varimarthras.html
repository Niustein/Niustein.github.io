        <h2>TL;DR</h2>
        <ul id="TLDR">
            <li>Tanks swap as soon as the other player gets hit by Shadow Strike</li>
            <li>Rest of raid stacks together</li>
            <li>Move Left/Right (depending on where you are) when Dark fissure is cast</li>
            <li>Be loosely lined up for Marked Prey so the person that gets kicked can avoid Misery</li>
            <li>(Heroic Only) Move Necrotic Embrace out of raid</li>
            <li>Recommended Lust/Hero timings: On the pull</li>            
            <li>?</li>
            <li>Loot</li>
        </ul>    
        
        
        <h2>Boss Abilities:</h2>
        <p id="BAbilities">
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=243961/misery">Misery</a>is a debuff that prevents all healing for 7 seconds and increases the physical damage taken by 200%. This debuff is applied whenever anyone takes shadow damage<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A plethora of abilities will trigger Misery, so the other abilities will have to be dealt with correctly.<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=243963/alone-in-the-darkness">Alone in the Darkness</a>does shadow damage to any target that is not within 8 yards of another player. Because of the shadow damage, this will apply Misery<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be stacked with the group, only leaving and taking this hit when absolutely necessary (necrotic embrace in Heroic, and shadow strike for tanks)<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=243960/shadow-strike">Shadow Strike</a>is cast when Varimarthras hits 100 energy and deals a massive shadow hit to the tank (hits in a cone in Heroic)<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tank not hit by shadow strike has to taunt the boss after this goes off. On heroic difficulty, nobody can be in front of the boss when it goes off <br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=243967/torment-of-flames">Torment of Flames</a>deals raid wide fire damage every second.<br><br>
        
                
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=243974/torment-of-shadows">Torment of Shadows</a>deals raid wide shadow damage every second starting at 6 minutes into the encounter. At this point, nobody will receive any healing due to misery and the raid will likely wipe (soft enrage)<br><br>
        
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=243976/torment-of-frost">Torment of Frost (Heroic Only)</a>deals raid wide frost damage every second from 2-4 minutes into the encounter. Movement speed is reduced by 40%, therefore players must be concious to move earlier to dodge dark fissure and necrotic embrace.<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=243979/torment-of-fel">Torment of Fel (Heroic Only)</a>deals Fire damage every 5 seconds from 4-6 minutes into the encounter and each tick increases in damage by 50%. Healers will likely have to coordinate cooldowns in this phase <br><br>

                
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=243999/dark-fissure">Dark Fissure</a>Varimarthras opens void rifts under 3 random players which deals ticking damage every 3 seconds to anyone caught inside. After 6 seconds the rift expires and deals massive damage to anyone caught inside<br>
        
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Players should be stacked to place all the voids close to each other and should move to left or right to a designated spot<br><br>
         
         -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244042/marked-prey">Marked Prey</a>Varimarthras targets a random player and charges towards them after 5 seconds. The first target he hits will be punted backwards<br>
        
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Players should be stacked and have a melee with a dash take the hit.<br><br>
         
         -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244093/necrotic-embrace">Necrotic Embrace (Heroic Only)</a>Varimarthras corrupts a taget. After 6 seconds it explodes dealing shadow damage and applying Necrotic Embrace to any other players within 10 yards.<br>
        
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The player with necrotic embrace should be topped off and should leave the group before the debuff expires. They will take a hit of alone in the darkness and therefore misery, and should rejoin the raid after the debuff expires.<br><br>
