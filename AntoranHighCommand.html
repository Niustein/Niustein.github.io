        <h2>Boss Abilities:</h2>
        <p id="BAbilities">
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244892/exploit-weakness">Exploit Weakness</a>does a large amount of physical damage in a cone and applies a debuff increasing the physical ddamage you take by 75%<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanks should point this away from the raid and swap on 2 stacks<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=257974/chaos-pulse">Chaos Pulse</a>inflicts damage and applies a stacking debuff (up to 15%) extra damage to the target. All three bosses will use this and all three pods will have this ability for the player to use.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the player in the pod: keep this active on the current boss at all times. Towards the end of the fight if healers have their dispell up they can dispelll priority targets who have this ability on them<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=245546/summon-reinforcements">Summon Reinforcements</a>will summon three adds (one pyromancer and two shocktroopers). The pyromancer will begin casting pyroblast. The shocktroopers will target one of the further targets in the raid and dash to them and begin spinning on them.<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interrupt pyroblast and kill the pyromancer (less of a target on the first pod whose ability does lots of damage to adds). Cleave down the shocktroopers with the boss as they are less of a priority. The person in the first pod should use the pods' special ability Withering Fire to kill the adds very quickly. <br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=245161/entropic-mine">Entropic Mines</a>will spawn a number of mines around players during the 1st and 3rd pods. When these mines are triggered they deal a moderate burst of damage while applying a ticking dot to the raid. After 3 minutes and 45 seconds the mines will detonate on their own (applying the dot to the raid). <br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In times of low amounts of damage, have someone hit a mine to reduce the overall number. The person in the third pod should use the pods' special ability Summon Disruptor Beacon to remove as many mines from the field as possible<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244627/fusillade">Fusillade</a>barrages the arena dealing massive fire damage to the entire raid. This occurs during the 2nd and 3rd pods. Each fusillade cast increases the damage of the next cast by 25%, stacking infinitely. <br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person in the second pod should use the second pods' special ability felshield emitter to place activatable shields that reduce the damage from fusillade by 50%. One assigned player should use the emitter when fusillade cast is called. Fusillade gets cast 6 total times per rotation, so the person in the pod should place 6 emitters down (3 by the second pod, and 3 by the third pod) <br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244172/psychic-assault">Psychic Assault</a>The player inside of the pod will take a flat amount of damage (on Heroic, this dot stacks) Healers will have to be mindful of the person inside of the pods and keep them topped up.<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On heroic difficulty, it is advisable to assign two players per pod to deal with stacking dot (or have an extra player specialize as tank to stay in for almost the entire duration). <br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244388/psychic-scarring">Psychic Scarring (Heroic Only)</a>When a player leaves the pod, they cannot enter a new pod for 3 minutes. This means that you must assign at least 3 (if running tank strategy) or 6 (if running normal composition) to deal with each pod<br>
