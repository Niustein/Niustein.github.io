        <h2>Boss Abilities:</h2>
        <p id="BAbilities">
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=253189/shivan-pact">Shivan-Pact</a>is a buff that requires the two mothers active to be more than 18 yards apart from one another or they take 99% reduced damage<br>
               
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=244899/fiery-strike">Fiery Strike</a>. Noura: Deals a large amount of fire damage in a cone in front of her applying a stacking debuff which increases damage taken by future Fiery Strikes by 100%.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanks should taunt swap at ~5 stacks of firey strike (+/- depending on how strong your tanks are)<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=245627/whirling-saber">Whirling Saber</a>. Noura: throws a whirling saber at a random target and does damage upon landing. The saber then slowly makes its way back to Noura and deals damage to anyone in its path.<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dodge the impact damage and make sure not to be in the path on its way back<br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=245303/touch-of-darkness">Touch of Darkness</a>. Asara: deals uninterruptable bursts of damage to the raid.<br><br>
        
                
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=245281/shadow-blades">Shadow Blades</a>. Asara: conjures three shadow blades and after a few seconds sends them flying dealing damage to anyone in their path.<br><br>
        
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=245518/flashfreeze">Flash Freeze</a>. Diima: Similar to Fiery Strikes, deals a large burst of damage and applies a debuff that reduces movement speed by 10% for 20 seconds. <br><br>
        
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=245586/chilled-blood">Chilled Blood</a>. Diima: randomly targets multiple members of the raid with an absorb shield that must be healed. With the debuff times out, the player will be stunned where the duration is based on the amount of absorb shield remaining.<br><br>

                
        -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=253429/fulminating-pulse">Fulminating Pulse (Heroic Only)</a>. Noura: Randomly targets 3+ members of the raid with a heavy ticking DoT that must be healed through. At the end of the DoT is an explosion that deals a large amount of damage to anyone within 6 yards<br>
        
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Healers will need to keep players topped up through this DoT, as anyone at around 50% hp for the explosion will likely die.<br><br>
         
         -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=252861/storm-of-darkness">Storm of Darkness (Heroic Only)</a>. Asara: Covers the area in a mass of darkness. There are multiple safe zones which players must make their way too.<br>
        
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Players should do everything they can to make sure they're in a safe zone, as well as be aware of the other mechanics going off at the same time (whirling saber, shadow blades, fulminating pulse, chilled blood, etc)<br><br>
         
         -<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=253650/orb-of-frost">Orb of Frost (Heroic Only)</a>. Diima: Targets a random ranged player and places a giant orb of frost on them. The orb does a low amount of damage on initial placement, and from that point on slows the movement speed of all players within 30 yards by a massive amount. The slow is reduced the further away from the center of the orb <br><br>
         
        
        </p> 
        
        <h2>Add Phases:</h2>
        <p id="extraInfo">
        -There are 4 different types of Adds. Aman'thul, Golganneth, Khaz'goroth, Norgannon<br><br>
        
        -4 Aman'thul adds will spawn along the walls of the room that will begin channeling "Machinations of Aman'Thul". At the end of the cast, the add will regenerate to 100% hp and apply a stacking dot on the raid. It is imperative that these adds die as fast as possible and not allowing more than 2 casts to go off or the damage will likely overwhelm the party. <br><br>
        
        -Golganneth adds will spawn along the walls of the room and will cause any players within 2 yards of eachother to take massive amounts of damage. Players must be careful to not get within 2 yards of each other at any point during this add phase. <br><br>
        
        -6 Khaz'goroth adds will spawn and cast a firey beam across the center of the room. Players must make sure to avoid the fire and kill off the adds before additional mechanics are involved. <br><br>
        
        -Norgannon adds will spawn all around the room like a box and slowly walk to the other side of the room. They only have 1 HP but cannot take damage for 30 seconds. They can be CC'd and players should do everything they can to get behind the adds while still staying in a safe position. On heroic difficult, this can sometimes be difficult based on the other mechanics going through at the same time (Storm of Darkness and Fulminating Pulse). <br><br>
        
        -The difficulty in this fight (especially on Heroic difficult) lies in the overlap of abilities. Storm of darkness + many others is particularly nasty. The enrage on the fight is very forgiving, so mechanics and living above everything else.
